## Dicey-Challenge

- The objective is to roll any number between 1 and 6 for both the players just by refreshing the page. Once the page is refreshed the dice rolls for player one and 2 and  shows a numer on the webpage.
- The player with greater count on the dice wins
- If the number of dots on both the dice is same, its a draw.
- Happy playing :)
